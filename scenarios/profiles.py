"""
scenarios/profiles.py — which catalog metrics each scenario cares about.

Filtering happens at SSOT read time (not at extraction time). Rationale:
  - Extraction stays scenario-agnostic — the SSOT is a complete asset record
    that future scenarios (Lease Review, Debt Analysis) can reuse without
    re-ingesting.
  - Each scenario tool reads only its allowed metrics before building the
    GPT prompt. This keeps narratives focused and prevents the model from
    drifting into metrics that aren't its concern.

Profile rules per category:
  - "all"                        → include every metric in the category
  - {"include_names": [...]}     → include only these specific metric names

Metric names below MUST match the `metric_name` column in Snapshot Metric.xlsx
exactly (we validate this at import time with _validate_profile_names).
