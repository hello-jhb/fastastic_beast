"""
aam.py — Audit Appendix Metrics (AAM).

The AAM is the small, curated set of facts the engine must get right in the
FIRST pass, before any business-plan narrative or deep-dive analysis. It is the
human-verification target: the analyst reviews and signs off on these metrics
(the "audit appendix") before the engine traces formulas outward (Stage 2) to
gather everything else.

Design intent (2026-06-10 redesign):
  - Stage 1 extraction is scoped to the AAM ONLY, so a single focused pass can
    nail them instead of a broad 5-section sweep over all 109 catalog metrics.
  - Every AAM id is an existing `in_bounded_list` catalog metric — AAM is a
    SCOPE over the catalog, NOT a new metric definition.

Interest Rate is represented as floating-rate components (base/index rate +
spread + cap) per the design decision, rather than a single all-in rate.
